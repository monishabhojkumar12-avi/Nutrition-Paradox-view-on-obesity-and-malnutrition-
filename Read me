⚖️ Nutrition Paradox: A Global View on Obesity and Malnutrition
📌 Project Overview

The Nutrition Paradox project analyzes the coexistence of rising obesity and persistent malnutrition across countries, regions, age groups, and genders using WHO public health datasets.
The project applies ETL, data cleaning, SQL analytics, EDA, and visualization to uncover global nutrition trends and support data-driven public health decision-making.

🎯 Problem Statement

As a Data Analyst for a global health organization, the objective is to investigate how undernutrition and overnutrition vary worldwide.
Using publicly available WHO data, the project explores:

Country-wise and regional trends

Adult vs child nutrition patterns

Gender disparities

Changes over time (2012–2022)

The goal is to derive actionable insights that can guide policy planning and health interventions.

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

Loaded 4 WHO datasets using APIs

Filtered data between 2012–2022

Added age_group column:

Adult

Child/Adolescent

Combined:

Obesity datasets → df_obesity

Malnutrition datasets → df_malnutrition

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Columns Retained & Renamed:

Year

Gender

Mean_Estimate

LowerBound

UpperBound

CI_Width

Age_Group

Country

Region

Obesity_Level / Malnutrition_Level

Key Enhancements:

Converted ISO Alpha-3 country codes to full names using pycountry

Handled special region codes (GLOBAL, AFR, EUR, etc.)

Calculated Confidence Interval Width

Categorized nutrition risk levels:

Low / Moderate / High

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of obesity and malnutrition

Trend analysis over time

Regional and demographic comparisons

Obesity vs malnutrition contrast

Visualizations:

Line charts (time trends)

Bar charts (top/bottom countries)

Box plots (regional variability)

Scatter plots (nutrition comparison)

Heatmaps (CI_Width patterns)

4️⃣ SQL Database Integration

Created SQL database

Created two tables:

obesity

malnutrition

Inserted cleaned data using Python

5️⃣ SQL Analytics (25 Queries)
🧋 Obesity (10 Queries)

Top regions by obesity

Top countries with high obesity

Public Health Reporting

🔍 Key Insights

Obesity and malnutrition coexist in several regions

Children show higher variability in malnutrition risk

Gender disparities are visible across multiple countries

CI_Width highlights data reliability differences by region

📈 Deliverables

Cleaned obesity & malnutrition datasets

SQL tables and 25 analytical queries

Python EDA notebook with visualizations

Power BI dashboard or Streamlit app

Insight-driven summary & recommendations

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can support global health strategies by identifying nutrition risks and disparities.
It highlights the paradoxical relationship between overnutrition and undernutrition and shows how Python, SQL, and visualization tools can transform public health data into meaningful insights.
